ActionController::UnknownFormat (MoviesController#show is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (ReviewsController#index is missing a template for this request format and variant.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (CommentsController#show is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (CommentsController#show is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

This latest Batman opus, a sequel to \"Batman Begins\" that brings back most of the principal filmmakers and players, is an exhausting two and a half hours, almost none of it lacking in tension, violence, cruelty, mayhem and discomfort.\r\n\r\nIf you take this movie as seriously as it wants to be taken (and it's pretty difficult to avoid its grip), you will be wrung out. No one will wish it longer.\r\n\r\nThis is an accomplishment of sorts. The filmmakers want to spread as much doom, gloom and unease as they can, and they know how to do it. The long running time, in fact, can be explained not so much as a requirement of the plot, but simply because the filmmakers needed more room to explore every avenue of making you uneasy.\r\n\r\nOh yes, they might have said, we haven't put a loaded gun to the head of a child yet, with his parents begging the villain for mercy. Let's do that. Oh, and ...\r\n\r\nThis is a complex tale, though, not merely a cruel one. \"The Dark Knight\" is probably the smartest and most stylish action movie since the \"The Matrix.\" It thinks and philosophizes. The subject it thinks and philosophizes about, perhaps not surprisingly, considering the times, is the Iraq war.\r\n\r\nWe go right down the line, ruminating on terrorism, unilateralism, torture (and what it does to the perpetrators), even illegal phone-tapping. The movie asks the question: How can a tolerant, democratic (if corrupt) society save itself, and its principles, in the face of nihilistic intolerance? This results in some rather lumpy dialogue, but there's never very much of it.\r\n\r\nThe movie begins roughly where the last one left off. Gotham is a mess. A group of thugs in clown masks are robbing a bank, but not, it turns out, just any bank. It's a mob bank.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, the thugs in clown masks don't seem to have a whole lot of, well, esprit de corps. They proceed to knock each other off with the nonchalance of a Fred Astaire tap dance, until we find that the last clown standing is really a clown - the Joker himself.\r\n\r\nThe scene encapsulates one of the running themes of \"Dark Knight.\" You can't trust anyone. Everyone wears a mask.\r\n\r\nHeath Ledger, in his last role, is the Joker. You won't have any trouble spotting him - he's the guy stealing the movie. Given the nature of Ledger's death (drugs) you might assume that his would be merely an over-the-top, scenery-chewing, out-of-control performance. Far from it. This is a tightly controlled, tightly wound portrayal that seems to start with the voice - quiet, carefully enunciated, with the hint of a speech impediment or Southern drawl.\r\n\r\nHe's good with a knife, a magician with a pen (making one disappear into a guy's head). He's got a much more horrific back story than Jack Nicholson's Joker, and there's not an ounce of glee left in him (as his makeup reflects).\r\n\r\nHe's Gotham's worst nightmare, a man who videotapes his torture sessions and sends them to the networks, a man who's bent on using the freedoms of civilization against itself. Sound familiar? If you think of Al Qaeda, the filmmakers won't mind.\r\n\r\nThere's also a touch of Hannibal Lector in Ledger's Joker, but when I saw him saunter stiffly (which Ledger manages to pull off) away from the hospital that he's blowing up, I realized his trope: He's Forrest Gump gone mad.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale returns as a somber, poker-faced Bruce Wayne/Batman, a hero so reluctant that he'd rather not be one. The movie doesn't have the usual good vs. evil dynamic; our rooting interest is muted not only by Batman's troubled psyche, but also by a certain (intentional) confusion as to who, exactly, is good, anyway.\r\n\r\nCertainly, Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) are models of moral rectitude and avuncular support, but both are somewhat removed from the fray. Rachel (here played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Katie Holmes from \"Batman Begins\") is loyal, but to whom?\r\n\r\nGordon (Gary Oldman) is the everyman caught in the middle of the mess, but given the filmmakers' views of the everyman, we can never be too sure about him, either.\r\n\r\nThe movie definitely has a mean streak. Near the end, the Joker sets up an untidy situation where two groups of ordinary citizens must decide on the fate of the other, or die. The voting (for this is an exercise in Democracy under pressure, see?) is predicated entirely on self interest, and gets ugly fast.\r\n\r\nYou can't even trust the majority in this movie. Vigilantism is the only hope.\r\n\r\nThe violence, and certainly the intensity, of this movie seem R-rated, but the editors have cut away at the last moments from blood-spattering details to save the box office.\r\n\r\nAs I emerged from the screening, a security guard asked me to rate the movie on a scale of one to 10. I said that I really couldn't say (was I entertained, or mauled?), \"but don't take your kids.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's 50,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nI guess he can handle it."}, "commit"=>"Submit Review", "movie_id"=>"3"}

This latest Batman opus, a sequel to \"Batman Begins\" that brings back most of the principal filmmakers and players, is an exhausting two and a half hours, almost none of it lacking in tension, violence, cruelty, mayhem and discomfort.\r\n\r\nIf you take this movie as seriously as it wants to be taken (and it's pretty difficult to avoid its grip), you will be wrung out. No one will wish it longer.\r\n\r\nThis is an accomplishment of sorts. The filmmakers want to spread as much doom, gloom and unease as they can, and they know how to do it. The long running time, in fact, can be explained not so much as a requirement of the plot, but simply because the filmmakers needed more room to explore every avenue of making you uneasy.\r\n\r\nOh yes, they might have said, we haven't put a loaded gun to the head of a child yet, with his parents begging the villain for mercy. Let's do that. Oh, and ...\r\n\r\nThis is a complex tale, though, not merely a cruel one. \"The Dark Knight\" is probably the smartest and most stylish action movie since the \"The Matrix.\" It thinks and philosophizes. The subject it thinks and philosophizes about, perhaps not surprisingly, considering the times, is the Iraq war.\r\n\r\nWe go right down the line, ruminating on terrorism, unilateralism, torture (and what it does to the perpetrators), even illegal phone-tapping. The movie asks the question: How can a tolerant, democratic (if corrupt) society save itself, and its principles, in the face of nihilistic intolerance? This results in some rather lumpy dialogue, but there's never very much of it.\r\n\r\nThe movie begins roughly where the last one left off. Gotham is a mess. A group of thugs in clown masks are robbing a bank, but not, it turns out, just any bank. It's a mob bank.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, the thugs in clown masks don't seem to have a whole lot of, well, esprit de corps. They proceed to knock each other off with the nonchalance of a Fred Astaire tap dance, until we find that the last clown standing is really a clown - the Joker himself.\r\n\r\nThe scene encapsulates one of the running themes of \"Dark Knight.\" You can't trust anyone. Everyone wears a mask.\r\n\r\nHeath Ledger, in his last role, is the Joker. You won't have any trouble spotting him - he's the guy stealing the movie. Given the nature of Ledger's death (drugs) you might assume that his would be merely an over-the-top, scenery-chewing, out-of-control performance. Far from it. This is a tightly controlled, tightly wound portrayal that seems to start with the voice - quiet, carefully enunciated, with the hint of a speech impediment or Southern drawl.\r\n\r\nHe's good with a knife, a magician with a pen (making one disappear into a guy's head). He's got a much more horrific back story than Jack Nicholson's Joker, and there's not an ounce of glee left in him (as his makeup reflects).\r\n\r\nHe's Gotham's worst nightmare, a man who videotapes his torture sessions and sends them to the networks, a man who's bent on using the freedoms of civilization against itself. Sound familiar? If you think of Al Qaeda, the filmmakers won't mind.\r\n\r\nThere's also a touch of Hannibal Lector in Ledger's Joker, but when I saw him saunter stiffly (which Ledger manages to pull off) away from the hospital that he's blowing up, I realized his trope: He's Forrest Gump gone mad.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale returns as a somber, poker-faced Bruce Wayne/Batman, a hero so reluctant that he'd rather not be one. The movie doesn't have the usual good vs. evil dynamic; our rooting interest is muted not only by Batman's troubled psyche, but also by a certain (intentional) confusion as to who, exactly, is good, anyway.\r\n\r\nCertainly, Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) are models of moral rectitude and avuncular support, but both are somewhat removed from the fray. Rachel (here played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Katie Holmes from \"Batman Begins\") is loyal, but to whom?\r\n\r\nGordon (Gary Oldman) is the everyman caught in the middle of the mess, but given the filmmakers' views of the everyman, we can never be too sure about him, either.\r\n\r\nThe movie definitely has a mean streak. Near the end, the Joker sets up an untidy situation where two groups of ordinary citizens must decide on the fate of the other, or die. The voting (for this is an exercise in Democracy under pressure, see?) is predicated entirely on self interest, and gets ugly fast.\r\n\r\nYou can't even trust the majority in this movie. Vigilantism is the only hope.\r\n\r\nThe violence, and certainly the intensity, of this movie seem R-rated, but the editors have cut away at the last moments from blood-spattering details to save the box office.\r\n\r\nAs I emerged from the screening, a security guard asked me to rate the movie on a scale of one to 10. I said that I really couldn't say (was I entertained, or mauled?), \"but don't take your kids.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's 50,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nI guess he can handle it."}, "commit"=>"Update", "movie_id"=>"3", "id"=>"3"}

ActionController::UnknownFormat (ReviewsController#index is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

That's enough.\r\n\r\nProximo: That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.\r\n\r\nA foolish choice in art direction casts a pall over Ridley Scott's \"Gladiator\" that no swordplay can cut through. The film looks muddy, fuzzy and indistinct. Its colors are mud tones at the drab end of the palette, and it seems to have been filmed on grim and overcast days. This darkness and a lack of detail in the long shots helps obscure shabby special effects (the Colosseum in Rome looks like a model from a computer game), and the characters bring no cheer: They're bitter, vengeful, depressed. By the end of this long film, I would have traded any given gladiatorial victory for just one shot of blue skies. (There are blue skies in the hero's dreams of long-ago happiness, but that proves the point.) The story line is \"Rocky\" on downers. The hero, a general from Spain named Maximus (Russell Crowe), is a favorite of the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). After Maximus defeats the barbarians, Marcus names him protector of Rome. But he is left for dead by Marcus' son, a bitter rival named Commodus (the name comes from the Latin for \"convenient\" and not what you're thinking).\r\nAfter escaping and finding that his wife and son have been murdered, Maximus finds his way to the deserts of North Africa, where he is sold as a slave to Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), a manager of gladiators. When Commodus lifts his late father's ban on gladiators in Rome, in an attempt to distract the people from hunger and plagues, Maximus slashes his way to the top, and the movie ends, of course, with the Big Fight.\r\n\r\nThis same story could have been rousing entertainment; I have just revisited the wonderful \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" which is just as dimwitted but 12 times more fun. But \"Gladiator\" lacks joy. It employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if the characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.\r\n\r\nCommodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is one of those spoiled, self-indulgent, petulant Roman emperors made famous in the age of great Roman epics, which ended with \"Spartacus\" (1960). Watching him in his snits, I recalled Peter Ustinov's great Nero in \"Quo Vadis\" (1951), collecting his tears for posterity in tiny crystal vials. Commodus has unusual vices even for a Caesar; he wants to become the lover of his older sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), whose son he is bringing up as his heir.\r\nThe moral backbone of the story is easily mastered. Commodus wants to be a dictator, but is opposed by the senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi). The senators want him to provide sewers for the city's Greek district, where the plague is raging, but Commodus decides instead on a season of games. Proximo arrives with his seasoned gladiators from Africa, who prove nearly invincible and threaten the emperor's popularity. The moral lesson: It is good when gladiators slaughter everyone in sight, and then turn over power to the politicians.\r\n\r\nThe Colosseum productions play like professional wrestling. Events are staged to re-create famous battles, and after the visitors wipe out the home team, a puzzled Commodus tells his aide, \"My history's a little hazy--but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?\" Later, an announcer literally addresses the crowd in these words: \"Caesar is pleased to bring you the only undefeated champion in Roman history--the legendary Titus!\" The battle sequences are a pale shadow of the lucidly choreographed swordplay in \"Rob Roy\" (1995); instead of moves we can follow and strategy we can appreciate, Scott goes for muddled closeups of fearsome but indistinct events. The crowd cheers, although those in the cheaper seats are impossible to see because of the murky special effects.\r\n\r\nWhen Maximus wins his first big fight, it's up to Commodus to decide whether he will live or die. \"Live! Live!\" the fans chant, and Commodus, bowing to their will, signals with a \"thumbs up.\" This demonstrates that Commodus was not paying attention in Caesar School, since the practice at the Colosseum at that time was to close the thumb in the fist to signal life; an extended thumb meant death. Luckily, no one else in the Colosseum knows this, either.\r\n\r\nCrowe is efficient as Maximus: bearded, taciturn, brooding. His closest friend among the gladiators is played by Djimon Hounsou, who played the passionate slave in \"Amistad.\" Since protocol requires him to speak less than Maximus, he mostly looks ferocious, effectively.\r\nNielsen shows the film's most depth, as the sister. Phoenix is passable as Commodus, but a quirkier actor could have had more fun in the role. Old pros Harris, Jacobi and Reed are reliable; Scott does some fancy editing and a little digital work to fill the gaps left when Reed died during the production.\r\n\r\n\"Gladiator\" is being hailed by those with short memories as the equal of \"Spartacus\" and \"Ben-Hur.\" This is more like \"Spartacus Lite.\" Or dark. It's only necessary to think back a few months, to Julie Taymor's \"Titus,\" for a film set in ancient Rome that's immeasurably better to look at.

That's enough.\r\n\r\nProximo: That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.\r\n\r\nA foolish choice in art direction casts a pall over Ridley Scott's \"Gladiator\" that no swordplay can cut through. The film looks muddy, fuzzy and indistinct. Its colors are mud tones at the drab end of the palette, and it seems to have been filmed on grim and overcast days. This darkness and a lack of detail in the long shots helps obscure shabby special effects (the Colosseum in Rome looks like a model from a computer game), and the characters bring no cheer: They're bitter, vengeful, depressed. By the end of this long film, I would have traded any given gladiatorial victory for just one shot of blue skies. (There are blue skies in the hero's dreams of long-ago happiness, but that proves the point.) The story line is \"Rocky\" on downers. The hero, a general from Spain named Maximus (Russell Crowe), is a favorite of the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). After Maximus defeats the barbarians, Marcus names him protector of Rome. But he is left for dead by Marcus' son, a bitter rival named Commodus (the name comes from the Latin for \"convenient\" and not what you're thinking).\r\nAfter escaping and finding that his wife and son have been murdered, Maximus finds his way to the deserts of North Africa, where he is sold as a slave to Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), a manager of gladiators. When Commodus lifts his late father's ban on gladiators in Rome, in an attempt to distract the people from hunger and plagues, Maximus slashes his way to the top, and the movie ends, of course, with the Big Fight.\r\n\r\nThis same story could have been rousing entertainment; I have just revisited the wonderful \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" which is just as dimwitted but 12 times more fun. But \"Gladiator\" lacks joy. It employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if the characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.\r\n\r\nCommodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is one of those spoiled, self-indulgent, petulant Roman emperors made famous in the age of great Roman epics, which ended with \"Spartacus\" (1960). Watching him in his snits, I recalled Peter Ustinov's great Nero in \"Quo Vadis\" (1951), collecting his tears for posterity in tiny crystal vials. Commodus has unusual vices even for a Caesar; he wants to become the lover of his older sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), whose son he is bringing up as his heir.\r\nThe moral backbone of the story is easily mastered. Commodus wants to be a dictator, but is opposed by the senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi). The senators want him to provide sewers for the city's Greek district, where the plague is raging, but Commodus decides instead on a season of games. Proximo arrives with his seasoned gladiators from Africa, who prove nearly invincible and threaten the emperor's popularity. The moral lesson: It is good when gladiators slaughter everyone in sight, and then turn over power to the politicians.\r\n\r\nThe Colosseum productions play like professional wrestling. Events are staged to re-create famous battles, and after the visitors wipe out the home team, a puzzled Commodus tells his aide, \"My history's a little hazy--but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?\" Later, an announcer literally addresses the crowd in these words: \"Caesar is pleased to bring you the only undefeated champion in Roman history--the legendary Titus!\" The battle sequences are a pale shadow of the lucidly choreographed swordplay in \"Rob Roy\" (1995); instead of moves we can follow and strategy we can appreciate, Scott goes for muddled closeups of fearsome but indistinct events. The crowd cheers, although those in the cheaper seats are impossible to see because of the murky special effects.\r\n\r\nWhen Maximus wins his first big fight, it's up to Commodus to decide whether he will live or die. \"Live! Live!\" the fans chant, and Commodus, bowing to their will, signals with a \"thumbs up.\" This demonstrates that Commodus was not paying attention in Caesar School, since the practice at the Colosseum at that time was to close the thumb in the fist to signal life; an extended thumb meant death. Luckily, no one else in the Colosseum knows this, either.\r\n\r\nCrowe is efficient as Maximus: bearded, taciturn, brooding. His closest friend among the gladiators is played by Djimon Hounsou, who played the passionate slave in \"Amistad.\" Since protocol requires him to speak less than Maximus, he mostly looks ferocious, effectively.\r\nNielsen shows the film's most depth, as the sister. Phoenix is passable as Commodus, but a quirkier actor could have had more fun in the role. Old pros Harris, Jacobi and Reed are reliable; Scott does some fancy editing and a little digital work to fill the gaps left when Reed died during the production.\r\n\r\n\"Gladiator\" is being hailed by those with short memories as the equal of \"Spartacus\" and \"Ben-Hur.\" This is more like \"Spartacus Lite.\" Or dark. It's only necessary to think back a few months, to Julie Taymor's \"Titus,\" for a film set in ancient Rome that's immeasurably better to look at. The visual accomplishment of \"Titus\" shames \"Gladiator,\" and its story is a whole heck of a lot better than the \"Gladiator\" screenplay, even if Shakespeare didn't make his Titus the only undefeated champion in Roman history."}, "commit"=>"Update", "movie_id"=>"1", "id"=>"2"}

That's enough.\r\n\r\nProximo: That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.\r\n\r\nA foolish choice in art direction casts a pall over Ridley Scott's \"Gladiator\" that no swordplay can cut through. The film looks muddy, fuzzy and indistinct. Its colors are mud tones at the drab end of the palette, and it seems to have been filmed on grim and overcast days. This darkness and a lack of detail in the long shots helps obscure shabby special effects (the Colosseum in Rome looks like a model from a computer game), and the characters bring no cheer: They're bitter, vengeful, depressed. By the end of this long film, I would have traded any given gladiatorial victory for just one shot of blue skies. (There are blue skies in the hero's dreams of long-ago happiness, but that proves the point.) The story line is \"Rocky\" on downers. The hero, a general from Spain named Maximus (Russell Crowe), is a favorite of the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). After Maximus defeats the barbarians, Marcus names him protector of Rome. But he is left for dead by Marcus' son, a bitter rival named Commodus (the name comes from the Latin for \"convenient\" and not what you're thinking).\r\nAfter escaping and finding that his wife and son have been murdered, Maximus finds his way to the deserts of North Africa, where he is sold as a slave to Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), a manager of gladiators. When Commodus lifts his late father's ban on gladiators in Rome, in an attempt to distract the people from hunger and plagues, Maximus slashes his way to the top, and the movie ends, of course, with the Big Fight.\r\n\r\nThis same story could have been rousing entertainment; I have just revisited the wonderful \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" which is just as dimwitted but 12 times more fun. But \"Gladiator\" lacks joy. It employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if the characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.\r\n\r\nCommodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is one of those spoiled, self-indulgent, petulant Roman emperors made famous in the age of great Roman epics, which ended with \"Spartacus\" (1960). Watching him in his snits, I recalled Peter Ustinov's great Nero in \"Quo Vadis\" (1951), collecting his tears for posterity in tiny crystal vials. Commodus has unusual vices even for a Caesar; he wants to become the lover of his older sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), whose son he is bringing up as his heir.\r\n\r\nThe moral backbone of the story is easily mastered. Commodus wants to be a dictator, but is opposed by the senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi). The senators want him to provide sewers for the city's Greek district, where the plague is raging, but Commodus decides instead on a season of games. Proximo arrives with his seasoned gladiators from Africa, who prove nearly invincible and threaten the emperor's popularity. The moral lesson: It is good when gladiators slaughter everyone in sight, and then turn over power to the politicians.\r\n\r\nThe Colosseum productions play like professional wrestling. Events are staged to re-create famous battles, and after the visitors wipe out the home team, a puzzled Commodus tells his aide, \"My history's a little hazy--but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?\" Later, an announcer literally addresses the crowd in these words: \"Caesar is pleased to bring you the only undefeated champion in Roman history--the legendary Titus!\" The battle sequences are a pale shadow of the lucidly choreographed swordplay in \"Rob Roy\" (1995); instead of moves we can follow and strategy we can appreciate, Scott goes for muddled closeups of fearsome but indistinct events. The crowd cheers, although those in the cheaper seats are impossible to see because of the murky special effects.\r\n\r\nWhen Maximus wins his first big fight, it's up to Commodus to decide whether he will live or die. \"Live! Live!\" the fans chant, and Commodus, bowing to their will, signals with a \"thumbs up.\" This demonstrates that Commodus was not paying attention in Caesar School, since the practice at the Colosseum at that time was to close the thumb in the fist to signal life; an extended thumb meant death. Luckily, no one else in the Colosseum knows this, either.\r\n\r\nCrowe is efficient as Maximus: bearded, taciturn, brooding. His closest friend among the gladiators is played by Djimon Hounsou, who played the passionate slave in \"Amistad.\" Since protocol requires him to speak less than Maximus, he mostly looks ferocious, effectively.\r\nNielsen shows the film's most depth, as the sister.

That's enough.\r\nProximo: That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.\r\nA foolish choice in art direction casts a pall over Ridley Scott's \"Gladiator\" that no swordplay can cut through. The film looks muddy, fuzzy and indistinct. Its colors are mud tones at the drab end of the palette, and it seems to have been filmed on grim and overcast days. This darkness and a lack of detail in the long shots helps obscure shabby special effects (the Colosseum in Rome looks like a model from a computer game), and the characters bring no cheer: They're bitter, vengeful, depressed. By the end of this long film, I would have traded any given gladiatorial victory for just one shot of blue skies. (There are blue skies in the hero's dreams of long-ago happiness, but that proves the point.) The story line is \"Rocky\" on downers. The hero, a general from Spain named Maximus (Russell Crowe), is a favorite of the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). After Maximus defeats the barbarians, Marcus names him protector of Rome. But he is left for dead by Marcus' son, a bitter rival named Commodus (the name comes from the Latin for \"convenient\" and not what you're thinking).\r\nAfter escaping and finding that his wife and son have been murdered, Maximus finds his way to the deserts of North Africa, where he is sold as a slave to Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), a manager of gladiators. When Commodus lifts his late father's ban on gladiators in Rome, in an attempt to distract the people from hunger and plagues, Maximus slashes his way to the top, and the movie ends, of course, with the Big Fight.\r\nThis same story could have been rousing entertainment; I have just revisited the wonderful \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" which is just as dimwitted but 12 times more fun. But \"Gladiator\" lacks joy. It employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if the characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.\r\nCommodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is one of those spoiled, self-indulgent, petulant Roman emperors made famous in the age of great Roman epics, which ended with \"Spartacus\" (1960). Watching him in his snits, I recalled Peter Ustinov's great Nero in \"Quo Vadis\" (1951), collecting his tears for posterity in tiny crystal vials. Commodus has unusual vices even for a Caesar; he wants to become the lover of his older sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), whose son he is bringing up as his heir.\r\nThe moral backbone of the story is easily mastered. Commodus wants to be a dictator, but is opposed by the senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi). The senators want him to provide sewers for the city's Greek district, where the plague is raging, but Commodus decides instead on a season of games. Proximo arrives with his seasoned gladiators from Africa, who prove nearly invincible and threaten the emperor's popularity. The moral lesson: It is good when gladiators slaughter everyone in sight, and then turn over power to the politicians.\r\nThe Colosseum productions play like professional wrestling. Events are staged to re-create famous battles, and after the visitors wipe out the home team, a puzzled Commodus tells his aide, \"My history's a little hazy--but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?\" Later, an announcer literally addresses the crowd in these words: \"Caesar is pleased to bring you the only undefeated champion in Roman history--the legendary Titus!\" The battle sequences are a pale shadow of the lucidly choreographed swordplay in \"Rob Roy\" (1995); instead of moves we can follow and strategy we can appreciate, Scott goes for muddled closeups of fearsome but indistinct events. The crowd cheers, although those in the cheaper seats are impossible to see because of the murky special effects.\r\nWhen Maximus wins his first big fight, it's up to Commodus to decide whether he will live or die. \"Live! Live!\" the fans chant, and Commodus, bowing to their will, signals with a \"thumbs up.\" This demonstrates that Commodus was not paying attention in Caesar School, since the practice at the Colosseum at that time was to close the thumb in the fist to signal life; an extended thumb meant death. Luckily, no one else in the Colosseum knows this, either.\r\nCrowe is efficient as Maximus: bearded, taciturn, brooding. His closest friend among the gladiators is played by Djimon Hounsou, who played the passionate slave in \"Amistad.\" Since protocol requires him to speak less than Maximus, he mostly looks ferocious, effectively.\r\nNielsen shows the film's most depth, as the sister. Phoenix is passable as Commodus, but a quirkier actor could have had more fun in the role. Old pros Harris, Jacobi and Reed are reliable; Scott does some fancy editing and a little digital work to fill the gaps left when Reed died during the production.\r\n\"Gladiator\" is being hailed by those with short memories as the equal of \"Spartacus\" and \"Ben-Hur.\" This is more like \"Spartacus Lite.\" Or dark. It's only necessary to think back a few months, to Julie Taymor's \"Titus,\" for a film set in ancient Rome that's immeasurably better to look at.

ActionController::UnknownFormat (ReviewsController#index is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

That's enough.\r\n\r\nProximo: That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.\r\n\r\nA foolish choice in art direction casts a pall over Ridley Scott's \"Gladiator\" that no swordplay can cut through. The film looks muddy, fuzzy and indistinct. Its colors are mud tones at the drab end of the palette, and it seems to have been filmed on grim and overcast days. This darkness and a lack of detail in the long shots helps obscure shabby special effects (the Colosseum in Rome looks like a model from a computer game), and the characters bring no cheer: They're bitter, vengeful, depressed. By the end of this long film, I would have traded any given gladiatorial victory for just one shot of blue skies. (There are blue skies in the hero's dreams of long-ago happiness, but that proves the point.) The story line is \"Rocky\" on downers. The hero, a general from Spain named Maximus (Russell Crowe), is a favorite of the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). After Maximus defeats the barbarians, Marcus names him protector of Rome. But he is left for dead by Marcus' son, a bitter rival named Commodus (the name comes from the Latin for \"convenient\" and not what you're thinking).\r\n\r\nAfter escaping and finding that his wife and son have been murdered, Maximus finds his way to the deserts of North Africa, where he is sold as a slave to Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), a manager of gladiators. When Commodus lifts his late father's ban on gladiators in Rome, in an attempt to distract the people from hunger and plagues, Maximus slashes his way to the top, and the movie ends, of course, with the Big Fight."}, "commit"=>"Update", "movie_id"=>"2", "id"=>"3"}

That's enough.\r\n\r\nProximo: That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.\r\n\r\nA foolish choice in art direction casts a pall over Ridley Scott's \"Gladiator\" that no swordplay can cut through. The film looks muddy, fuzzy and indistinct. Its colors are mud tones at the drab end of the palette, and it seems to have been filmed on grim and overcast days. This darkness and a lack of detail in the long shots helps obscure shabby special effects (the Colosseum in Rome looks like a model from a computer game), and the characters bring no cheer: They're bitter, vengeful, depressed. By the end of this long film, I would have traded any given gladiatorial victory for just one shot of blue skies. (There are blue skies in the hero's dreams of long-ago happiness, but that proves the point.) The story line is \"Rocky\" on downers. The hero, a general from Spain named Maximus (Russell Crowe), is a favorite of the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). After Maximus defeats the barbarians, Marcus names him protector of Rome. But he is left for dead by Marcus' son, a bitter rival named Commodus (the name comes from the Latin for \"convenient\" and not what you're thinking).\r\n\r\nAfter escaping and finding that his wife and son have been murdered, Maximus finds his way to the deserts of North Africa, where he is sold as a slave to Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), a manager of gladiators. When Commodus lifts his late father's ban on gladiators in Rome, in an attempt to distract the people from hunger and plagues, Maximus slashes his way to the top, and the movie ends, of course, with the Big Fight.\r\n\r\nThis same story could have been rousing entertainment; I have just revisited the wonderful \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" which is just as dimwitted but 12 times more fun. But \"Gladiator\" lacks joy. It employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if the characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.\r\nCommodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is one of those spoiled, self-indulgent, petulant Roman emperors made famous in the age of great Roman epics, which ended with \"Spartacus\" (1960). Watching him in his snits, I recalled Peter Ustinov's great Nero in \"Quo Vadis\" (1951), collecting his tears for posterity in tiny crystal vials. Commodus has unusual vices even for a Caesar; he wants to become the lover of his older sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), whose son he is bringing up as his heir.\r\n\r\nThe moral backbone of the story is easily mastered. Commodus wants to be a dictator, but is opposed by the senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi). The senators want him to provide sewers for the city's Greek district, where the plague is raging, but Commodus decides instead on a season of games. Proximo arrives with his seasoned gladiators from Africa, who prove nearly invincible and threaten the emperor's popularity. The moral lesson: It is good when gladiators slaughter everyone in sight, and then turn over power to the politicians.\r\n\r\nThe Colosseum productions play like professional wrestling. Events are staged to re-create famous battles, and after the visitors wipe out the home team, a puzzled Commodus tells his aide, \"My history's a little hazy--but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?\" Later, an announcer literally addresses the crowd in these words: \"Caesar is pleased to bring you the only undefeated champion in Roman history--the legendary Titus!\" The battle sequences are a pale shadow of the lucidly choreographed swordplay in \"Rob Roy\" (1995); instead of moves we can follow and strategy we can appreciate, Scott goes for muddled closeups of fearsome but indistinct events. The crowd cheers, although those in the cheaper seats are impossible to see because of the murky special effects.\r\nWhen Maximus wins his first big fight, it's up to Commodus to decide whether he will live or die. \"Live! Live!\" the fans chant, and Commodus, bowing to their will, signals with a \"thumbs up.\" This demonstrates that Commodus was not paying attention in Caesar School, since the practice at the Colosseum at that time was to close the thumb in the fist to signal life; an extended thumb meant death. Luckily, no one else in the Colosseum knows this, either.\r\nCrowe is efficient as Maximus: bearded, taciturn, brooding. His closest friend among the gladiators is played by Djimon Hounsou, who played the passionate slave in \"Amistad.\" Since protocol requires him to speak less than Maximus, he mostly looks ferocious, effectively.\r\n\r\nNielsen shows the film's most depth, as the sister. Phoenix is passable as Commodus, but a quirkier actor could have had more fun in the role. Old pros Harris, Jacobi and Reed are reliable; Scott does some fancy editing and a little digital work to fill the gaps left when Reed died during the production.\r\n\r\n\"Gladiator\" is being hailed by those with short memories as the equal of \"Spartacus\" and \"Ben-Hur.\" This is more like \"Spartacus Lite.\" Or dark. It's only necessary to think back a few months, to Julie Taymor's \"Titus,\" for a film set in ancient Rome that's immeasurably better to look at. The visual accomplishment of \"Titus\" shames \"Gladiator,\" and its story is a whole heck of a lot better than the \"Gladiator\" screenplay, even if Shakespeare didn't make his Titus the only undefeated champion in Roman history."}, "commit"=>"Update", "movie_id"=>"2", "id"=>"3"}

The hero, a general from Spain named Maximus (Russell Crowe), is a favorite of the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). After Maximus defeats the barbarians, Marcus names him protector of Rome. But he is left for dead by Marcus' son, a bitter rival named Commodus (the name comes from the Latin for \"convenient\" and not what you're thinking).\r\n\r\nAfter escaping and finding that his wife and son have been murdered, Maximus finds his way to the deserts of North Africa, where he is sold as a slave to Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), a manager of gladiators. When Commodus lifts his late father's ban on gladiators in Rome, in an attempt to distract the people from hunger and plagues, Maximus slashes his way to the top, and the movie ends, of course, with the Big Fight.\r\n\r\nThis same story could have been rousing entertainment; I have just revisited the wonderful \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" which is just as dimwitted but 12 times more fun. But \"Gladiator\" lacks joy. It employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if the characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.\r\nCommodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is one of those spoiled, self-indulgent, petulant Roman emperors made famous in the age of great Roman epics, which ended with \"Spartacus\" (1960). Watching him in his snits, I recalled Peter Ustinov's great Nero in \"Quo Vadis\" (1951), collecting his tears for posterity in tiny crystal vials. Commodus has unusual vices even for a Caesar; he wants to become the lover of his older sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), whose son he is bringing up as his heir.\r\n\r\nThe moral backbone of the story is easily mastered. Commodus wants to be a dictator, but is opposed by the senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi). The senators want him to provide sewers for the city's Greek district, where the plague is raging, but Commodus decides instead on a season of games. Proximo arrives with his seasoned gladiators from Africa, who prove nearly invincible and threaten the emperor's popularity. The moral lesson: It is good when gladiators slaughter everyone in sight, and then turn over power to the politicians.\r\n\r\nThe Colosseum productions play like professional wrestling. Events are staged to re-create famous battles, and after the visitors wipe out the home team, a puzzled Commodus tells his aide, \"My history's a little hazy--but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?\" Later, an announcer literally addresses the crowd in these words: \"Caesar is pleased to bring you the only undefeated champion in Roman history--the legendary Titus!\" The battle sequences are a pale shadow of the lucidly choreographed swordplay in \"Rob Roy\" (1995); instead of moves we can follow and strategy we can appreciate, Scott goes for muddled closeups of fearsome but indistinct events. The crowd cheers, although those in the cheaper seats are impossible to see because of the murky special effects.\r\nWhen Maximus wins his first big fight, it's up to Commodus to decide whether he will live or die. \"Live! Live!\" the fans chant, and Commodus, bowing to their will, signals with a \"thumbs up.\" This demonstrates that Commodus was not paying attention in Caesar School, since the practice at the Colosseum at that time was to close the thumb in the fist to signal life; an extended thumb meant death. Luckily, no one else in the Colosseum knows this, either.\r\nCrowe is efficient as Maximus: bearded, taciturn, brooding. His closest friend among the gladiators is played by Djimon Hounsou, who played the passionate slave in \"Amistad.\" Since protocol requires him to speak less than Maximus, he mostly looks ferocious, effectively.\r\n\r\nNielsen shows the film's most depth, as the sister. Phoenix is passable as Commodus, but a quirkier actor could have had more fun in the role. Old pros Harris, Jacobi and Reed are reliable; Scott does some fancy editing and a little digital work to fill the gaps left when Reed died during the production.\r\n\r\n\"Gladiator\" is being hailed by those with short memories as the equal of \"Spartacus\" and \"Ben-Hur.\" This is more like \"Spartacus Lite.\" Or dark. It's only necessary to think back a few months, to Julie Taymor's \"Titus,\" for a film set in ancient Rome that's immeasurably better to look at. The visual accomplishment of \"Titus\" shames \"Gladiator,\" and its story is a whole heck of a lot better than the \"Gladiator\" screenplay, even if Shakespeare didn't make his Titus the only undefeated champion in Roman history."], ["updated_at", 2017-02-28 22:05:09 UTC], ["id", 3]]

There is a universal need to believe in an outfit that exists outside the rules and can get things done.\r\n\r\nThere's a related need for a place where the rules are suspended, where there's no day or night, where everything has a price, where if you're lucky, you go home a millionaire. Of course, people who go to Vegas lose money, and people who deal with the mob, regret it. But hope is what we're talking about. Neither the mob nor Vegas could exist if most people weren't optimists.\r\n\r\nMartin Scorsese's fascinating new film \"Casino\" knows a lot about the Mafia's relationship with Las Vegas. It's based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi, who had full access to a man who once ran four casinos for the mob, and whose true story inspires the movie's plot.\r\nLike \"The Godfather,\" it makes us feel like eavesdroppers in a secret place.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with a car bombing, and the figure of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein floating through the air. The movie explains how such a thing came to happen to him. The first hour plays like a documentary; there's a narration, by Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and others, explaining how the mob skimmed millions out of the casinos.\r\n\r\nIt's an interesting process. Assuming you could steal 25 percent of the slot-machine take - what would you do with tons of coins? How would you convert them into bills that could be stuffed into the weekly suitcase for delivery to the mob in Kansas City? \"Casino\" knows. It also knows how to skim from the other games, and from food service and the gift shops. And it knows about how casinos don't like to be stolen from.\r\n\r\nThere's an incident where a man is cheating at blackjack, and a couple of security guys sidle up to him and jab him with a stun gun.\r\n\r\nHe collapses, the security guys call for medical attention, and hurry him away to a little room where they pound on his fingers with a mallet and he agrees that he made a very bad mistake.\r\n\r\nRothstein, based on the real-life figure of Frank (Lefty) Rosenthal, starts life as a sports oddsmaker in Chicago, attracts the attention of the mob because of his genius with numbers and is assigned to run casinos because he looks like an efficient businessman who will encourage the Vegas goose to continue laying its golden eggs. He is a man who detests unnecessary trouble. One day, however, trouble finds him, in the person of Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), a high-priced call girl.\r\n\r\nScorsese shows him seeing Ginger on a TV security monitor and falling so instantly in love that the image becomes a freeze-frame.\r\n\r\nAce showers her with gifts, which she is happy to have, but when he wants to marry her, she objects; she's been with a pimp named Lester Diamond (James Woods) since she was a kid, and she doesn't want to give up her profession. Rothstein will make her an offer she can't refuse: cars, diamonds, furs, a home with a pool and the key to his safety-deposit box. She marries him. It is Ace's first mistake.\r\nAnother mistake was to meet Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) when they were both kids in Chicago. Nicky is a thief and a killer, who comes to Vegas, forms a crew and throws his weight around. After he squeezes one guy's head in a vise, the word goes out that he's the mob's enforcer. Not true, but people believe it, and soon Nicky's name is being linked with his old pal Ace in all the newspapers.\r\n\r\nScorsese tells his story with the energy and pacing he's famous for, and with a wealth of little details that feel just right. Not only the details of tacky 1970s period decor, but little moments such as when Ace orders the casino cooks to put \"exactly the same amount of blueberries in every muffin.\" Or when airborne feds are circling a golf course while spying on the hoods, and their plane runs out of gas and they have to make an emergency landing right on the green.\r\n\r\nAnd when crucial evidence is obtained because a low-level hood kept a record of his expenses. And when Ace hosts a weekly show on local TV - and reveals a talent for juggling.\r\nMeanwhile, Ginger starts drinking, and Ace is worried about their kid, and they start having public fights, and she turns to Nicky for advice that soon becomes consolation, and when Ace finds out she may be fooling around, he utters a line that, in its way, is perfect: \"I just hope it's not somebody who I think it might be.\" \"It was,\" a narrator tells us, \"the last time street guys would ever be given such an opportunity.\" All the mob had to do was take care of business. But when Ace met Ginger and when Nicky came to town, the pieces were in place for the mob to become the biggest loser in Vegas history. \"We screwed up good,\" Nicky says, not using exactly those words. Scorsese gets the feel, the mood, almost the smell of the city just right; De Niro and Pesci inhabit their roles with unconscious assurance, Stone's call girl is her best performance, and the supporting cast includes such people as Don Rickles, whose very presence evokes an era (his job is to stand impassively beside the boss and look very sad about what might happen to whoever the boss is talking to).\r\nUnlike his other Mafia movies (\"Mean Streets\" and \"GoodFellas\"), Scorsese's \"Casino\" is as concerned with history as with plot and character. The city of Las Vegas is his subject, and he shows how it permitted people like Ace, Ginger and Nicky to flourish, and then spit them out, because the Vegas machine is too profitable and powerful to allow anyone to slow its operation. When the Mafia, using funds from the Teamsters union, was ejected in the late 1970s, the 1980s ushered in a new source of financing: junk bonds. The guys who floated those might be the inspiration for \"Casino II.\" \"The big corporations took over,\" the narrator observes, almost sadly. \"Today, it works like Disneyland.\" Which brings us back to our opening insight. In a sense, people need to believe a town like Vegas is run by guys like Ace and Nicky.\r\n\r\nIn a place that breaks the rules, maybe you can break some, too.

There is a universal need to believe in an outfit that exists outside the rules and can get things done.\r\n\r\nThere's a related need for a place where the rules are suspended, where there's no day or night, where everything has a price, where if you're lucky, you go home a millionaire. Of course, people who go to Vegas lose money, and people who deal with the mob, regret it. But hope is what we're talking about. Neither the mob nor Vegas could exist if most people weren't optimists.\r\n\r\nMartin Scorsese's fascinating new film \"Casino\" knows a lot about the Mafia's relationship with Las Vegas. It's based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi, who had full access to a man who once ran four casinos for the mob, and whose true story inspires the movie's plot.\r\nLike \"The Godfather,\" it makes us feel like eavesdroppers in a secret place.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with a car bombing, and the figure of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein floating through the air. The movie explains how such a thing came to happen to him. The first hour plays like a documentary; there's a narration, by Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and others, explaining how the mob skimmed millions out of the casinos.\r\n\r\nIt's an interesting process. Assuming you could steal 25 percent of the slot-machine take - what would you do with tons of coins? How would you convert them into bills that could be stuffed into the weekly suitcase for delivery to the mob in Kansas City? \"Casino\" knows. It also knows how to skim from the other games, and from food service and the gift shops. And it knows about how casinos don't like to be stolen from.\r\n\r\nThere's an incident where a man is cheating at blackjack, and a couple of security guys sidle up to him and jab him with a stun gun.\r\n\r\nHe collapses, the security guys call for medical attention, and hurry him away to a little room where they pound on his fingers with a mallet and he agrees that he made a very bad mistake.\r\n\r\nRothstein, based on the real-life figure of Frank (Lefty) Rosenthal, starts life as a sports oddsmaker in Chicago, attracts the attention of the mob because of his genius with numbers and is assigned to run casinos because he looks like an efficient businessman who will encourage the Vegas goose to continue laying its golden eggs.

That's enough.\r\n\r\nProximo: That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.\r\n\r\nA foolish choice in art direction casts a pall over Ridley Scott's \"Gladiator\" that no swordplay can cut through. The film looks muddy, fuzzy and indistinct. Its colors are mud tones at the drab end of the palette, and it seems to have been filmed on grim and overcast days. This darkness and a lack of detail in the long shots helps obscure shabby special effects (the Colosseum in Rome looks like a model from a computer game), and the characters bring no cheer: They're bitter, vengeful, depressed. By the end of this long film, I would have traded any given gladiatorial victory for just one shot of blue skies. (There are blue skies in the hero's dreams of long-ago happiness, but that proves the point.) The story line is \"Rocky\" on downers. The hero, a general from Spain named Maximus (Russell Crowe), is a favorite of the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). After Maximus defeats the barbarians, Marcus names him protector of Rome. But he is left for dead by Marcus' son, a bitter rival named Commodus (the name comes from the Latin for \"convenient\" and not what you're thinking).\r\n\r\nAfter escaping and finding that his wife and son have been murdered, Maximus finds his way to the deserts of North Africa, where he is sold as a slave to Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), a manager of gladiators. When Commodus lifts his late father's ban on gladiators in Rome, in an attempt to distract the people from hunger and plagues, Maximus slashes his way to the top, and the movie ends, of course, with the Big Fight.\r\n\r\nThis same story could have been rousing entertainment; I have just revisited the wonderful \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" which is just as dimwitted but 12 times more fun. But \"Gladiator\" lacks joy. It employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if the characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.\r\nCommodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is one of those spoiled, self-indulgent, petulant Roman emperors made famous in the age of great Roman epics, which ended with \"Spartacus\" (1960). Watching him in his snits, I recalled Peter Ustinov's great Nero in \"Quo Vadis\" (1951), collecting his tears for posterity in tiny crystal vials. Commodus has unusual vices even for a Caesar; he wants to become the lover of his older sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), whose son he is bringing up as his heir.\r\n\r\nThe moral backbone of the story is easily mastered. Commodus wants to be a dictator, but is opposed by the senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi). The senators want him to provide sewers for the city's Greek district, where the plague is raging, but Commodus decides instead on a season of games. Proximo arrives with his seasoned gladiators from Africa, who prove nearly invincible and threaten the emperor's popularity. The moral lesson: It is good when gladiators slaughter everyone in sight, and then turn over power to the politicians.\r\n\r\nThe Colosseum productions play like professional wrestling. Events are staged to re-create famous battles, and after the visitors wipe out the home team, a puzzled Commodus tells his aide, \"My history's a little hazy--but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?\" Later, an announcer literally addresses the crowd in these words: \"Caesar is pleased to bring you the only undefeated champion in Roman history--the legendary Titus!\" The battle sequences are a pale shadow of the lucidly choreographed swordplay in \"Rob Roy\" (1995); instead of moves we can follow and strategy we can appreciate, Scott goes for muddled closeups of fearsome but indistinct events. The crowd cheers, although those in the cheaper seats are impossible to see because of the murky special effects.\r\nWhen Maximus wins his first big fight, it's up to Commodus to decide whether he will live or die. \"Live! Live!\" the fans chant, and Commodus, bowing to their will, signals with a \"thumbs up.\" This demonstrates that Commodus was not paying attention in Caesar School, since the practice at the Colosseum at that time was to close the thumb in the fist to signal life; an extended thumb meant death. Luckily, no one else in the Colosseum knows this, either.\r\nCrowe is efficient as Maximus: bearded, taciturn, brooding. His closest friend among the gladiators is played by Djimon Hounsou, who played the passionate slave in \"Amistad.\" Since protocol requires him to speak less than Maximus, he mostly looks ferocious, effectively.\r\n\r\nNielsen shows the film's most depth, as the sister. Phoenix is passable as Commodus, but a quirkier actor could have had more fun in the role. Old pros Harris, Jacobi and Reed are reliable; Scott does some fancy editing and a little digital work to fill the gaps left when Reed died during the production.\r\n\r\n\"Gladiator\" is being hailed by those with short memories as the equal of \"Spartacus\" and \"Ben-Hur.\" This is more like \"Spartacus Lite.\" Or dark. It's only necessary to think back a few months, to Julie Taymor's \"Titus,\" for a film set in ancient Rome that's immeasurably better to look at. The visual accomplishment of \"Titus\" shames \"Gladiator,\" and its story is a whole heck of a lot better than the \"Gladiator\" screenplay, even if Shakespeare didn't make his Titus the only undefeated champion in Roman history."}, "commit"=>"Update", "movie_id"=>"2", "id"=>"3"}

This latest Batman opus, a sequel to \"Batman Begins\" that brings back most of the principal filmmakers and players, is an exhausting two and a half hours, almost none of it lacking in tension, violence, cruelty, mayhem and discomfort.\r\n\r\nIf you take this movie as seriously as it wants to be taken (and it's pretty difficult to avoid its grip), you will be wrung out. No one will wish it longer.\r\n\r\nThis is an accomplishment of sorts. The filmmakers want to spread as much doom, gloom and unease as they can, and they know how to do it. The long running time, in fact, can be explained not so much as a requirement of the plot, but simply because the filmmakers needed more room to explore every avenue of making you uneasy.\r\n\r\nOh yes, they might have said, we haven't put a loaded gun to the head of a child yet, with his parents begging the villain for mercy. Let's do that. Oh, and ...\r\n\r\nThis is a complex tale, though, not merely a cruel one. \"The Dark Knight\" is probably the smartest and most stylish action movie since the \"The Matrix.\" It thinks and philosophizes. The subject it thinks and philosophizes about, perhaps not surprisingly, considering the times, is the Iraq war.\r\n\r\nWe go right down the line, ruminating on terrorism, unilateralism, torture (and what it does to the perpetrators), even illegal phone-tapping. The movie asks the question: How can a tolerant, democratic (if corrupt) society save itself, and its principles, in the face of nihilistic intolerance? This results in some rather lumpy dialogue, but there's never very much of it.\r\n\r\nThe movie begins roughly where the last one left off. Gotham is a mess. A group of thugs in clown masks are robbing a bank, but not, it turns out, just any bank. It's a mob bank.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, the thugs in clown masks don't seem to have a whole lot of, well, esprit de corps. They proceed to knock each other off with the nonchalance of a Fred Astaire tap dance, until we find that the last clown standing is really a clown - the Joker himself.\r\n\r\nThe scene encapsulates one of the running themes of \"Dark Knight.\" You can't trust anyone. Everyone wears a mask.\r\n\r\nHeath Ledger, in his last role, is the Joker. You won't have any trouble spotting him - he's the guy stealing the movie. Given the nature of Ledger's death (drugs) you might assume that his would be merely an over-the-top, scenery-chewing, out-of-control performance. Far from it. This is a tightly controlled, tightly wound portrayal that seems to start with the voice - quiet, carefully enunciated, with the hint of a speech impediment or Southern drawl.\r\n\r\nHe's good with a knife, a magician with a pen (making one disappear into a guy's head). He's got a much more horrific back story than Jack Nicholson's Joker, and there's not an ounce of glee left in him (as his makeup reflects).\r\n\r\nHe's Gotham's worst nightmare, a man who videotapes his torture sessions and sends them to the networks, a man who's bent on using the freedoms of civilization against itself. Sound familiar? If you think of Al Qaeda, the filmmakers won't mind.\r\n\r\nThere's also a touch of Hannibal Lector in Ledger's Joker, but when I saw him saunter stiffly (which Ledger manages to pull off) away from the hospital that he's blowing up, I realized his trope: He's Forrest Gump gone mad.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale returns as a somber, poker-faced Bruce Wayne/Batman, a hero so reluctant that he'd rather not be one. The movie doesn't have the usual good vs. evil dynamic; our rooting interest is muted not only by Batman's troubled psyche, but also by a certain (intentional) confusion as to who, exactly, is good, anyway.\r\n\r\nCertainly, Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) are models of moral rectitude and avuncular support, but both are somewhat removed from the fray. Rachel (here played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Katie Holmes from \"Batman Begins\") is loyal, but to whom?\r\n\r\nGordon (Gary Oldman) is the everyman caught in the middle of the mess, but given the filmmakers' views of the everyman, we can never be too sure about him, either.\r\n\r\nThe movie definitely has a mean streak. Near the end, the Joker sets up an untidy situation where two groups of ordinary citizens must decide on the fate of the other, or die. The voting (for this is an exercise in Democracy under pressure, see?) is predicated entirely on self interest, and gets ugly fast.\r\n\r\nYou can't even trust the majority in this movie. Vigilantism is the only hope.\r\n\r\nThe violence, and certainly the intensity, of this movie seem R-rated, but the editors have cut away at the last moments from blood-spattering details to save the box office.\r\n\r\nAs I emerged from the screening, a security guard asked me to rate the movie on a scale of one to 10. I said that I really couldn't say (was I entertained, or mauled?), \"but don't take your kids.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's 50,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nI guess he can handle it."}, "commit"=>"Submit Review", "movie_id"=>"3"}

And they call to a girl named Moana.\r\n\r\nNonsense, you say? Well, her father, Chief Tu, would agree with you. His strictest rule forbids anyone—especially his daughter—from sailing beyond their island's surrounding reef. The danger is just too great. Better to stay put on their peaceful, beautiful isle, he tells her, and prepare for the day when she will lay a stone on the sacred site—like her ancestors before her—to become the first female chief of their people.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, the sea never goes away. Rules and duty don't make a calling disappear. And that never-silent whisper repeats over and over, telling Moana that something awaits her on the waves. Something so very important. Something that involves, believe it or not, the legendary demigod Maui.\r\n\r\nNow, you may not know that tale, but Maui's story is nothing new to young Moana. Her Gramma Tala has told it to her since she was just a tiny child. And it sings in her heart.\r\n\r\nIt's the story of a shapeshifting demigod who uses an oversized magical hook to transform himself into all manner of birds or sea creatures. The story tells of him stealing the gem-like heart of Te Fiti, the Mother Island and creator of all things. And it recounts Maui's battle with a huge, dangerous lava monster that attacks the mischievous demigod, sending both his hook and the heart of Te Fiti to the deepest depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nNow, most folks on Moana's island would likely insist that outsized tale is nothing more than a silly myth. Of course, they'd also claim that the steady deterioration spreading through their part of the Pacific is nothing either. The fish disappearing, the lush foliage turning brown, the coconuts rotting on the trees—all this has nothing to do with an island god's missing heart, they would say.\r\n\r\nBut Moana knows better.\r\n\r\nShe also knows that her Gramma's story ends with a hero's prophecy: A brave soul will someday sail far into the ocean, find the hook and the gem-heart and force the scheming Maui to replace what he once stole away. That task will take someone with courage, someone with strength and fortitude. It will require a person who confronts the dangers of that quest and heeds the calls of the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd though Moana knows nothing of sailing, and nothing of standing up to great danger or of battling powerful foes, she does know one thing: She knows that she hears the call.\r\n\r\nAnd the ocean's powerful song is one she cannot resist.\r\n\r\nPOSITIVE ELEMENTS\r\nMoana does indeed set out on her sea-going journey and meets the demigod Maui … who turns out to be something of a conceited jerk. But eventually he learns lessons of loyalty and sacrifice—qualities that define Moana's character.\r\n\r\nMoana's a focused and determined teen girl who is willing to face death in order to help her people and to right wrongs that have been perpetrated in the past. And the movie reinforces the important idea that striving to do what's good and right will result in a better world.\r\n\r\nEven though Moana's Gramma Tala wants her granddaughter to break out and follow the \"voice inside,\" she also encourages Moana to mind her father. For his part, Moana's seemingly overprotective dad is adamant about his reef rules because he lost a childhood friend in that place, and he wants to keep anyone else from harm, if possible.\r\n\r\nSPIRITUAL CONTENT\r\nThis whole film is loosely based on Hawaiian mythology about a demigod and an island goddess. As such, it's predictably packed with all the trappings of those particular mythological legends about creation, demigods and the magical powers of the sea—not to mention some of the fierce creatures that live there. At one point, for instance, Moana and Maui must venture down an incredibly deep hole into a subterranean \"realm of monsters\" dominated by a giant magical crab.\r\n\r\nA glowing, stingray-like spirit of a deceased loved one—and a more human-looking version of that spirit—both guide Moana at points along her journey. Moana's ancestors send her a dream-like vision of their past seagoing travels.\r\n\r\nMaui is covered with tattoos that appear on his body after he accomplishes great deeds. The moving tattoos also wordlessly interact with Maui himself, illustrating scenes of importance.\r\n\r\nSEXUAL CONTENT\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nVIOLENT CONTENT\r\nWhile never overly perilous, there are a few thumping moments in the movie mix. Maui goes toe-to-toe with a giant, fireball-lobbing Lava Giant on a couple of occasions, getting bashed about and slightly singed in the process. Moana has to duck some massive fireballs herself. A giant crab slashes at the heroes, repeatedly mashing Maui into the ground. Little coconut pirates, called the Kakamora, throw spears and shoot blow darts.\r\n\r\nSeveral people are battered about by ocean waves and raked across an underwater coral reef in the process. Someone gets a foot caught in a coral crag and is temporarily trapped under water. Another character is reportedly killed (off-camera). Elsewhere, a man gets a painful tattoo.\r\n\r\nCRUDE OR PROFANE LANGUAGE\r\nAn angry Moana yells out an unfinished, \"You lying son of a …\" Maui complains about being shot in the \"butt cheek\" by a drugged dart.\r\n\r\nDRUG AND ALCOHOL CONTENT\r\nThe Kakamora pirates shoot blow darts coated with some kind of tranquilizer drug that leaves victims temporarily paralyzed. Maui gets hit by one.\r\n\r\nOTHER NEGATIVE ELEMENTS\r\nMoana feels compelled to break her father's rule about the reef. (She later apologizes for her disobedience, but by then he recognizes that she was trying to accomplish a greater good.) Maui repeatedly mentions his intention to eat Moana's pet chicken. Two subtle toilety giggles involve urinating in the sea.\r\n\r\nMaui talks briefly of being abandoned and tossed into the sea by his parents, a revelation that could cause anxiety on the part of children (especially, perhaps, those who’ve been adopted or those from broken homes)\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBright and colorful animation paired with catchy songs signal the arrival of another new Disney princess in Moana.\r\n\r\nNow, Moana herself would deny that there's anything particularly princessy about her. But as we watch her sally forth and sing her songs, and as we chuckle over her featherbrained and bug-eyed chicken sidekick, well, that fine-tuned Mouse House princess template can't help but show through.\r\n\r\nThis time around, Disney has shifted away from its typical focus on fairy tales and love stories, setting its narrative sights on a blend of Hawaiian myth and Pacific Ocean adventure. Also veering from the script a bit is Dwayne Johnson-voiced Maui, who's much more a rogue-like foil than a prince-like hero. But everything still fits the blueprint. And it's an enjoyable design, to be sure.\r\n\r\nThe film's messages of striving to make your mark, dreaming your dreams and overcoming your obstacles are equally familiar. Those themes definitely reinforce the film's upbeat and unmissable girl-power vibe, but not so much that young boys would likely be too put off by it. Meanwhile, parents are treated to yet another popcorn-munching pic full of fantastical magic, seasoned with do-the-right-thing wishes and just a dash of buy-this-Disney-plush-toy commercialism.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of magic, the movie's mythological milieu parallels what we might expect to see in a similar story about Greek or Roman gods and goddesses. But for Christian parents who want to engage fully with this film's narrative, there are plenty of compare-and-contrast observations to be made about how Moana's spiritual outlook overlaps a bit with Christianity … and where it differs significantly from it.\r\n\r\nThat said, the spiritual elements in Moana never seem occultish or unnavigable. They merely provide the backdrop for a story about a young woman courageously embracing her calling and bravely rescuing her people in the process.\r\n\r\nAnd that's a story Disney knows how to tell very well."}, "commit"=>"Submit Review", "movie_id"=>"3"}

And they call to a girl named Moana.\r\n\r\nNonsense, you say? Well, her father, Chief Tu, would agree with you. His strictest rule forbids anyone—especially his daughter—from sailing beyond their island's surrounding reef. The danger is just too great. Better to stay put on their peaceful, beautiful isle, he tells her, and prepare for the day when she will lay a stone on the sacred site—like her ancestors before her—to become the first female chief of their people.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, the sea never goes away. Rules and duty don't make a calling disappear. And that never-silent whisper repeats over and over, telling Moana that something awaits her on the waves. Something so very important. Something that involves, believe it or not, the legendary demigod Maui.\r\n\r\nNow, you may not know that tale, but Maui's story is nothing new to young Moana. Her Gramma Tala has told it to her since she was just a tiny child. And it sings in her heart.\r\n\r\nIt's the story of a shapeshifting demigod who uses an oversized magical hook to transform himself into all manner of birds or sea creatures. The story tells of him stealing the gem-like heart of Te Fiti, the Mother Island and creator of all things. And it recounts Maui's battle with a huge, dangerous lava monster that attacks the mischievous demigod, sending both his hook and the heart of Te Fiti to the deepest depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nNow, most folks on Moana's island would likely insist that outsized tale is nothing more than a silly myth. Of course, they'd also claim that the steady deterioration spreading through their part of the Pacific is nothing either. The fish disappearing, the lush foliage turning brown, the coconuts rotting on the trees—all this has nothing to do with an island god's missing heart, they would say.\r\n\r\nBut Moana knows better.\r\n\r\nShe also knows that her Gramma's story ends with a hero's prophecy: A brave soul will someday sail far into the ocean, find the hook and the gem-heart and force the scheming Maui to replace what he once stole away. That task will take someone with courage, someone with strength and fortitude. It will require a person who confronts the dangers of that quest and heeds the calls of the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd though Moana knows nothing of sailing, and nothing of standing up to great danger or of battling powerful foes, she does know one thing: She knows that she hears the call.\r\n\r\nAnd the ocean's powerful song is one she cannot resist.\r\n\r\nPOSITIVE ELEMENTS\r\nMoana does indeed set out on her sea-going journey and meets the demigod Maui … who turns out to be something of a conceited jerk. But eventually he learns lessons of loyalty and sacrifice—qualities that define Moana's character.\r\n\r\nMoana's a focused and determined teen girl who is willing to face death in order to help her people and to right wrongs that have been perpetrated in the past. And the movie reinforces the important idea that striving to do what's good and right will result in a better world.\r\n\r\nEven though Moana's Gramma Tala wants her granddaughter to break out and follow the \"voice inside,\" she also encourages Moana to mind her father.
